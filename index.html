                Hi my name is Selly Santoso.
                I work as a property sales person focusing in project marketing. I had also done
                some
                property development petrol station and drive thru restaurants.
                Through the journey I wonder how technology can streamline project marketing by
                delivering better functional front end by redesigning the backend database.
                My education background is in finance and database. Part of my study was pattern
                data
                analysis for stock market and I did brief work experience as teaching assistant
                for
                oracle and SAP database. My passion is in property and marketing. My dream work
                would be
                to deploy better functional realestate.com.au by redesigning the backend
                database.
                My craziest idea is to create database for indonesian properties to move from
                its
                current paper base manual ones.
